# Net-Trees
The input to this problem is a set of points in a general metric space.
We organize the points into a data structure called *net-tree* so that it allows efficient proximity queries for metrics with bounded dimension (doubling metrics).
This repository contains a Python implementation of semi-compressed net-trees.
